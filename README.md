# covid_project
The idea behind this project was develop a covid-19 dashbord, where the user can enter a country they are intrested in, and the result would be the cumulated number of Confirmed cases, the number of recovered patients and lastly the number of deaths. The initial code framework was taken from this website: https://red.ht/2U0tOiM
